		<h2>About Halpin Murphy Media</h2>
            <p>Halpin Murphy Media are a media company founded in 2015 by two current Limerick Institute of Technology Clonmel students called Patrick Halpin and Stephen Patrick Murphy. As part of their third year Team Project module in the BSc in Creative Multimedia the two students were tasked with completing a project that complimented their skill sets and also about learning new skills as well as expanding upon their existing skill sets. This in turn would see them as more attractive candidates for employment and the Team Project would be a key piece of their portfolio. </p>
            <p>The project that Halpin Murphy Media agreed and collaborated on was for a Web Application called Footie Stats of which you can find more information here. This project was approved by Lecturers in LIT Clonmel who felt that it would showcase their abilities. The team agreed upon forming that neither would have a black and white role in so much that both members of the team could work on any area of the project and learning outcomes would be shared by both members. Stephen primarily focused on creating the visuals and the structure of the web app while Patrick focused his attention on the Data side of the project and the server side of things.</p>
            <p>Stephen Patrick Murphy is a 27 year old Mature Student from County Laois who currently resides in Clonmel during the college term. Joining LIT Clonmel in September 2013 Stephen is in his final year of a BSc in Creative Multimedia. Stephen has a keen interest in design and also web design and front end development. Stephens other skills apart from this are Photography, Video Production, Graphic Design, Blogging and also Motion Design. Outside of work Stephen enjoys Archery, Soccer (his favourite team is Liverpool) and video games. </p>
