			<p>Footie Stats is an ongoing project by Halpin Murphy Media that caters for football fans. On this page you can find various information about Footie Stats and what it is that were trying to achieve.
            </p>
		<h3>What is Footie Stats?</h3>
			<p>Footie Stats is a Web Application that processes data from both live football games and also previous fixtures and then visualises this data and makes it more eye catching. The trend of displaying statistical information as purely numbers of very basic bar charts in the mainstream media is what inspired the idea of Footie Stats. 
            </p>
		<h3>Where is the data collected from?</h3>
			<p>At present all data is collected from one source which is xmlsoccer.com but there are plans to expand this to other sources in the future if the initial phase is successful. XML soccer can return the values of all the data we require in an XML file that we can call upon.
            </p>
		<h3>How is the data made graphical?</h3>
			<p>At present all data is inserted into dynamic visuals provided by HighCharts. High charts is an interactive JavaScript chart library and all charts are natively created by using custom JavaScript. By using variables we can replace static default values of highcharts and update these with our custom XML data to visualise the data.
            </p>
		<h3>Will other leagues become available or is this only for the Scottish Premier League?</h3>
			<p>The plan is to recreate this for several European leagues that gain a lot of coverage such as the English Premiership, Spanish LaLiga, German Bundesliga, French Ligue 1 and also the Italian Serie A. The reason that only the Scottish Premier League is available right now is because it is a free demo on XMLSoccer and the other leagues require a paid subscription. 
            </p>
		<h3>When finished will Footie Stats cost anything? </h3>
			<p>No the plan is to make Footie Stats available for everybody and not just a select few who register or pay a subscription like other sources. The costs of running the website will be paid for by advertising which will not intrude with the interface of the website. 
            </p>
		<h3>Apart from adding new leagues are there any further plans for Footie Stats?</h3>
			<p>Yes there is a roadmap for Footie Stats that include but not limited to:
            </p>
            	<ul>
                    <li>Making the site mobile Responsive</li>
                    <li>Implementing greater use of visuals</li>
                    <li>An Android Application</li>
                    <li>IOS Application</li>
                    <li>Windows Store App that is accessible on Windows phone and all Windows 10 devices such as Tablets, Desktops and also Xbox.</li>
                    <li>To have greater amount of stats available than currently</li>
                    <li>To be able to view an infographic of bygone seasons that contain lots of relevant statistical information.</li>
				</ul>
